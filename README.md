<h1>MNIST Dataset Classification with SVM and KNN</h1>
<p>This repository contains two Python programs for solving the MNIST dataset classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.</p>
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SVM Approach:</strong> The SVM-based program utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement a Support Vector Machine classifier. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and finding optimal hyperplanes for classification.</li>
    <li><strong>KNN Approach:</strong> The KNN-based program is programmed from scratch to indicate the intricacies of this model clearly. KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Dataset:</h2>
<p>The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is a widely used benchmark dataset for machine learning tasks, particularly in the field of computer vision.</p>
