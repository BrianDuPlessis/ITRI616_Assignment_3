<h1>MNIST Dataset Classification with SVM and KNN</h1>

This repository contains two Python programs for solving the MNIST dataset classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms.

Overview:

SVM Approach: The SVM-based program utilizes the scikit-learn library to implement a Support Vector Machine classifier. SVMs are known for their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and finding optimal hyperplanes for classification.

KNN Approach: The KNN-based program employs the scikit-learn library to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.

Dataset:
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). It is a widely-used benchmark dataset for machine learning tasks, particularly in the field of computer vision.
